If you look closely at the fields right now, you can see them — tiny green shoots pushing their way through the mulch, reaching toward the pale February sun. Spring is still a few weeks away on the calendar, but here at Moonbloom, the season has already begun underground. We have been preparing for this moment since autumn, amending the beds with compost, laying down cover crops, and tucking thousands of bulbs and corms into the cool earth. Now, the waiting is almost over.

This spring, we are growing an especially exciting mix of varieties. Our ranunculus collection has expanded to include soft peach, deep burgundy, and a creamy white that practically glows in early morning light. The anemones are coming in strong, and we have added several new sweet pea varieties that we cannot wait to see climbing the trellises. Tulips, snapdragons, and Iceland poppies will round out the early season, giving us a palette that ranges from whisper-soft pastels to bold, saturated jewel tones.

We will start bringing spring blooms to the farm stand in late March, weather permitting, with peak availability running through May. If you are a florist, event planner, or simply someone who loves having fresh flowers on the table, now is the time to start thinking about what you would like. Follow along here and on our social channels for weekly updates on what is blooming and what is headed to the stand next.
