If you look closely at the beds right now, you can see them — tiny green shoots pushing their way through the mulch, reaching toward the pale February sun. Spring is still a few weeks away on the calendar, but here at Moonbloom, the season has already begun underground. We have been preparing for this moment since autumn, amending the beds with compost, laying down cover crops, and getting our transplants started in the greenhouse. Now, the waiting is almost over.

This spring, we are growing an especially exciting mix of varieties. Our tomato collection has expanded to include several new heirlooms alongside our tried-and-true favorites. The greens are looking strong — lettuces, arugula, and kale are all coming up beautifully. We have also put in new herb beds with basil, cilantro, and dill, plus rows of snap peas and spring onions that should be among the first things ready for the stand.

We will start bringing spring produce to the farm stand in late March, weather permitting, with peak availability running through early summer. If you are someone who loves cooking with what is freshest, now is the time to start thinking about what you would like. Follow along here and on our social channels for weekly updates on what is ready and what is headed to the stand next.
