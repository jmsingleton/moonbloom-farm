We have been dreaming about this moment for a long time. After years of tending our five acres in the Sonoma Valley, nurturing the soil and coaxing beauty out of every season, we are finally ready to open the gates a little wider and invite you in. Welcome to Moonbloom Farms — a place where flowers grow slowly, chickens roam freely, and every day starts with dirt under our fingernails and gratitude in our hearts.

Moonbloom began as a simple idea: what if we grew things the way nature intended, without shortcuts, without synthetics, and without rushing? That idea has blossomed into a working flower farm, a seasonal produce garden, a small flock of heritage laying hens, and a farm stand that we are incredibly proud of. Everything here is grown and raised with care, from the first ranunculus of spring to the last dahlia of autumn.

This blog is where we will share the stories behind the seeds — the wins, the failures, the surprises that come with every growing season. We will post updates on what is blooming, what is available at the farm stand, and what life on the farm really looks like, muddy boots and all. We are glad you are here, and we hope you will stick around.
