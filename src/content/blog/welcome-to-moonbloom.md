We have been dreaming about this moment for a long time. After pouring ourselves into our land in Glen Ellen, nurturing the soil and learning what each season has to offer, we are finally ready to open the gates a little wider and invite you in. Welcome to Moonbloom Farm — a place where produce grows slowly, chickens roam freely, and every day starts with dirt under our fingernails and gratitude in our hearts.

Moonbloom began as a simple idea: what if we grew things the way nature intended, without shortcuts, without synthetics, and without rushing? That idea has grown into a working organic micro farm, a seasonal produce garden, a small flock of heritage laying hens, a line of farm goods like preserves and hot sauce, and a farm stand that we are incredibly proud of. Everything here is grown and raised with care, from the first spring greens to the last autumn squash.

This blog is where we will share the stories behind the seeds — the wins, the failures, the surprises that come with every growing season. We will post updates on what is ready for harvest, what is available at the farm stand, and what life on the farm really looks like, muddy boots and all. We are glad you are here, and we hope you will stick around.
