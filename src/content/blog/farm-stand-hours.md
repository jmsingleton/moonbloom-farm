The farm stand is officially open for the 2026 season, and we could not be more excited to welcome you. Whether you have been visiting us for years or this is your very first trip out to Moonbloom, here is everything you need to know about stopping by.

We are open Friday through Sunday, from 9 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon. You will find us at the front of the property, just past the gravel parking area — look for the hand-painted sign. On any given weekend, the stand is stocked with whatever is freshest from the farm: seasonal produce, bundles of herbs, farm-fresh eggs from our heritage hens, and a rotating selection of farm goods including preserves and hot sauce. We also carry a curated collection of goods for your next Sonoma Valley adventure, including locally made honey, handcrafted soaps, and ceramics from local artisans.

A few things to keep in mind when you visit: we are a working farm, so please stick to the designated paths and stand area. Well-behaved dogs on leashes are welcome. We accept cash, card, and most mobile payment methods. And if you see something you love but want to order in larger quantities — come talk to us. We love working with people to put something special together.
