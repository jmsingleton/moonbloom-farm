The farm stand is officially open for the 2026 season, and we could not be more excited to welcome you. Whether you have been visiting us for years or this is your very first trip out to Moonbloom, here is everything you need to know about stopping by.

We are open Friday through Sunday, from 9 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon. You will find us at the front of the property, just past the gravel parking area — look for the hand-painted sign and the flower buckets out front. On any given weekend, the stand is stocked with whatever is freshest from the farm: seasonal flower bouquets, bundles of herbs, farm-fresh eggs from our heritage hens, and a rotating selection of seasonal produce. We also carry a small collection of curated goods, including locally made honey, handcrafted soaps, and ceramic vases from Sonoma Valley artisans.

A few things to keep in mind when you visit: we are a working farm, so please stick to the designated paths and stand area. Well-behaved dogs on leashes are welcome. We accept cash, card, and most mobile payment methods. And if you see something you love but want to order in larger quantities — for a wedding, an event, or just because your kitchen table deserves a really spectacular arrangement — come talk to us. We love working with people to create something special, and custom orders are one of our favorite things to do.
